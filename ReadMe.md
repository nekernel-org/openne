# OpenNE

OpenNE is a **modular microkernel and bootloader** written in **C++20**, designed for **performance, portability, and scalability**.  
Inspired by NT Kernel and microkernel architectures, it features **APIC-based multiprocessing, a custom filesystem (OpenNeFS), and EFI-based booting**.  

We welcome contributions and improvements—feel free to submit PRs or issues!
